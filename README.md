# Movie Sentiment Analysis Using Transformers 

This project implements sentiment analysis on IMDB movie reviews using XtremeDistilBERT (a distilled version of BERT). The objective is to classify movie reviews as positive or negative with high accuracy and efficiency.

## Features
- Utilizes Hugging Face Transformers library for text tokenization and modeling.
- Fine-tunes the microsoft/xtremedistil-l6-h256-uncased model for binary classification.
- Includes performance visualizations such as accuracy and loss graphs.
- Implements evaluation metrics like precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix for detailed analysis.

## Dataset
IMDB Movie Reviews Dataset: A collection of 50,000 labeled reviews split into training and test sets.

# Model
- XtremeDistilBERT: A lightweight and fast transformer model distilled from BERT.
- Fine-tuned for sentiment classification with a max sequence length of 512.

## Future Enhancements
- Hyperparameter tuning for further optimization.
- Extending to larger and more diverse datasets.
- Deploying the model for real-time sentiment analysis applications.
